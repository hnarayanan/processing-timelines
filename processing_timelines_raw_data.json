I’m glad we have this platform, it helped me stay optimistic and relatively calm this period.\n\n• Eligibility: ILRDV (1 month) + married to a British Spouse\n\n• Application Method: Online application through TLS\n\n• Application Date: 16th of February 2025\n\n• Biometric Date: 25th of February 2025\n\n• Email from Home Office requesting for extra Information: 11th April 2025 at 13:49, I replied same day at 23:06\n\n• Approval Date: Email received from Council today 9th of May 2025 at 16:34. Nothing from Home office yet.\n\n• Ceremony Date: As stated in the email, set for 1st of July 2025\n\nI have been through so much. I had lived in the UK for 5 years and 4 months as at the time of my citizenship application. Although ex husband had initiated divorce proceedings and cancelled my spouse visa 5 months before as a way to get me deported and separated from my daughter (a British Citizen, I was able to get ILRDV and applied the next week for British Citizenship. I applied immediately because based on other things I am currently going through, waiting one year (to qualify under ILR alone) would have put me under more stress and anxiety. So I applied straight away because we are still legally married (no final court decree of divorce yet) so I could do so as spouse of British citizen. I was open and honest with Home Office about everything and had a lot of evidence to explain and give context to my situation both for ILR and citizenship application. I didn’t let some lawyers who told me it was difficult or impossible to discourage me. Thankfully, I guess, I couldn’t even afford them. \nI prayed and asked God for guidance. I did both applications myself as I only knew about charities and their availability to help immigrants quite late after I had applied for ILR already. Also charity involvement concluded before I got my ILR so I felt alone, maybe because I am not very comfortable with asking for help. I also used Chat GPT a lot and I was very thorough reading all Hone Office guidance and appendixes regarding ILR and citizenship after ILR. I feel to cry, it’s been such a journey. My mental and physical health has suffered so much at the hands of this man, he is so perfect outside, I couldn’t get help at first because nobody believed me. I had a heart attack at work (26F I don’t drink or smoke) so things were really bad, I had no appetite and I cried nearly every 5 hours daily. I could hardly recognise myself sometimes.\nIt means so much to now be a British citizen. I am no longer the odd one out in my family and he holds nothing over my head, he cannot control me anymore. And I will never be separated from my child, we have equal rights in the UK. God is good.",

After submitting, i became concerned because of the average timelines approved within 2 months shared here. \n\nUpon reviwing my application, i realised i was not physically in the Uk 5 years ago when i applied, which is a strict requirement clearly stated in the guidance. Knowing this, i had alredy paid the fee and completed biometrics and decided not to withdraw it accepting there was a real risk of refusal and i would not get refund anyway. \n\nThe intersting part: based on the rule that i must have been in UK exactly 5 years when applied, my qualifying date would have been last week. So i started hoping that the  caseworker had some fair discretion, they might just hold onto my application until that date passed. And that\\`s exactly what happened. \n\nToday i received the approval. \n\nThis give hope to us that they do seem to exercise fair discretion, but also recomend double check the application before submit it  :D \n\nEligibility: ILR\n\nApplication Method: Online\n\nApplication date: 23 FEB/25\n\nBiometric date: 7 March/25\n\nApproval date: 11 July/25\n\nCeremony date: TBC",

From: home.office.atlas@notifications.service.gov.uk)\n\nCeremony Date: 20th September\n\n  \nThanks everyone, you've kept me sane. I found it so strange to walk out of the biometric appointment - I did self scan all of my documents - and was expecting them to look at my referee documents and verify the signed pictures etc, but they did none of that. The TLS email also said that UKVI will confirm the receipt of the application but they never did (and they don't as you have told me - thank you everyone!).",

Compiling all the times I entered and exited the country was quite challenging, as some of the emails were on my family members’ phones. Additionally, proving residency for the past five years was difficult because I attended university and lived in university accommodation for four years.\n\nLife in the UK test was incredibly tough and I failed twice. I’m relieved that it’s all behind me now, as it was ultimately worth it. \n\nBest of luck!",
