I have asked my MP to case it up with the home office but every response I have received it is   been copy and paste saying they have not come to a decision. I haven't even had a single response from the home office even after the 6 month timescale they give and normally they do say something like sorry it is taking longer then expected. Also I made a complete and revised the complaint but it was no help. \n\nI don't know what I can do. Literally It has impacted my mental health.",

            "body": "Just got my British citizenship approved today and thought my case might give hope to others in a similar situation.\n\nI applied in february via ILR route. After submitting, i became concerned because of the average timelines approved within 2 months shared here. \n\nUpon reviwing my application, i realised i was not physically in the Uk 5 years ago when i applied, which is a strict requirement clearly stated in the guidance. Knowing this, i had alredy paid the fee and completed biometrics and decided not to withdraw it accepting there was a real risk of refusal and i would not get refund anyway. \n\nThe intersting part: based on the rule that i must have been in UK exactly 5 years when applied, my qualifying date would have been last week. So i started hoping that the  caseworker had some fair discretion, they might just hold onto my application until that date passed. And that\\`s exactly what happened. \n\nToday i received the approval. \n\nThis give hope to us that they do seem to exercise fair discretion, but also recomend double check the application before submit it  :D \n\nEligibility: ILR\n\nApplication Method: Online\n\nApplication date: 23 FEB/25\n\nBiometric date: 7 March/25\n\nApproval date: 11 July/25\n\nCeremony date: TBC",

It is ironic, considering that normally applicants must pass a test on how life works in the UK — only to act so contrary to it soon afterwards.\n\nIt is also counterproductive. I imagine that if they didn't have to open, read, and respond to these ridicious emails, they would be able to process the applications faster. It may well be that the employees who reply to emails and who process applications are different people, but surely, if they didn't have to employ people to respond to emails, they could employ more for processing applications with their budget.\n\nIt must also be crowding out the requests by people who really need support.\n\nFinally, it is a useless bit of information to seek, even if there is a positive response to that email. You can see that in the posts by several people who emailed, as they say \"I emailed 26 times, and they replied today to say my application has been approved. Now what? Does anyone know when will I receive the official email so that I can book my ceremony?!\"\n\nBeing anxious or paying for the service cannot possibly justify this behaviour. I pay for my lunch, and am anxious how long it will take to arrive, because I really need to go back to work on time. But if I am told it will take 6 minutes before I order it, I don't call the waiter after 1, 2, 3... minutes to ask if it is ready yet. That would be ridicious.\n\nSo is emailing.",

They are not automatically British so I had to go this route. We do not live in the UK currently (which can complicate things).  \n\nTimeline: \n\nApplied and paid on 11 May 2025\n\nBiometrics 3 June 2025\n\nDidn't hear anything for a long time. I tried to call them to see whether my application had gone through. That did not help. I emailed so many different email addresses and finally got some response from [NationalityBiometricsOverseas@homeoffice.gov.uk](mailto:NationalityBiometricsOverseas@homeoffice.gov.uk) \\- this was the only email address I ever received a response from. \n\nAround the end of September, I had someone asking for all our supporting documents to upload to their system. I emailed everything to them. \n\n30 October 2025 I received an email saying our application had been approved! We are now waiting for the registration in the mail and then we can apply for a passport. No ceremony as applicant is under 18. \n\nSo in total from biometrics which is when they start counting, it took almost exactly 5 months to get a decision. \n\nHope this helps and happy to answer any questions.",

Naturally, you start questioning if you’ve done anything wrong and why is it taking so long for them to come back with a decision. I know every case is different but mine was very straightforward. I received ILR on the same day that I applied and there was nothing to go against me at all.\n\nSo my advice to all those who have been waiting beyond the 12 week point is to start emailing Citizenship Support weekly until you get an answer. I’ve been emailing them on average twice a week since 15th October and only today did someone reach out to me personally from the team. I emailed him back and within 10 minutes I received the approval email. So I believe this helped massively and my persistence did pay off. Some may not agree with the continuous emails but I’m just sharing my experience.\n\nHope this helps and good luck to you all 🎉",

Has anyone had anything similar? I messaged to the additional info email address to check whether the issue was verification or if I booked the wrong test, as the British council that I took the test with couldn’t see a problem.\n\nAny advice appreciated! \n\nEdit: I haven’t received a reply to my email yet but with grading times ref a new test I was getting worried I wasn’t going to meet the deadline to send a new one in, so booked one for this Sunday, sigh… love spending even more money \n\nEdit 2: why is nothing straight forward… after the language test saga (see below) I have received the Atlas email today, proceeded to book my ceremony and come to find out the council had a request for my citizenship certificate to be returned to the home office, no reason given, and hence can’t book in at this time. Emailed two email addresses and hoping for clarity but this is so unnerving. If anyone else has had this before do let me know! ",

Luckily, they were kind enough to fit me in — and I had my ceremony! 🎉 I’ve now received my naturalisation certificate and I’m so excited! 💃💃💃\n\n————————————\n\nSITUATION: \nThis morning (17 October) my council emailed “congratulations” and invited me to a group ceremony. However, I haven’t received any approval email from ATLAS/Home Office.\n\nI’ve booked the private ceremony for tomorrow morning (18 October)—it’s the only date I can do; the next options are late November. I’ve emailed Citizenship Support asking them to resend the approval email as it’s a requirement you have to provide on the day of the ceremony , but I’m worried I won’t be allowed to proceed without it.\n\nHas anyone experienced this? Were you able to attend with just the council’s invitation email? Any tips will be appreciated. Thanks for this platform!",

Only just recently applied, but thought that I'd throw in my details as well:\n\nApplication Timeline\n\n* Eligibility: ILR (Received in February 2022 after an IEC + Unmarried Spousal x2)\n* Application Method: Online\n* Application Date: 7 May 2025 (Email confirmation of fees rec'd on 8 May)\n* Biometric Date: 10 May 2025 (Croydon, paid appointment)\n* Approval Date: TBD\n* Ceremony Date: TBD (Requested Westminster, as the office is close to my work) \n\nHoping it comes through as quickly as it has for so many others!\n\n**01Aug:** update to say 'no update' and I haven't had any reply to my polite chase email. Very happy for all of the other approvals that have come through from around the same date!  \n**22Aug:** Received an email from nationalityfurtherinformationrequests@homeoffice.gov.uk after an email on 19Aug to citizenship.support@homeoffice.gov.uk which reads:  \n*\"Thank you for your email regarding the progress on your application for naturalisation as a British citizen.*  \n*Your application is currently under review and a number of enquiries need to be made before we can reach a decision on whether to grant citizenship.*  \n*These enquiries are still ongoing and as soon as they are completed we will ensure that a decision is taken, and that you will be notified accordingly.*  \n*We thank you for your patience at this time\"*. Not sure what kind of 'additional enquiries' would be related to my file, but hopefully it won't be delayed by too much...  \n**18Sep:** Still waiting... For reference, I've been in the UK for 11 years, never had a criminal record (never so much as missed a credit card payment or gotten a point on my licence!), I'm a native English speaker from a commonwealth country, I'm a civil servant and I own property here in the UK with only one house move in all of my 11 years - I know every application is individual, but it's disheartening to see applications from later weeks and months being approved. Good luck to everyone!!!  \n**30Sep:** No news as of yet - ho hum! I periodically check the council website every so often, but still nothing there. Hoping for something by Halloween :) (Although I'd love to know what's up with my application!)  \n**23Oct:** Emailed again as no news and, admittedly, it's driving me crazy!!! I was trying to hold out as it's only a couple more weeks until 6 months and I emailed them 2 months ago, but I'm getting anxious as I have a big trip planned at the end of November and I'm worried about things being approved while I'm abroad and what a headache it'll cause if I don't have a UK passport... I never dreamed that my application would take this long!  \n**7Nov:** Officially at 6 months since submission (give or take 3 days, if we count biometrics). No response to my last email just yet, but also nothing to say that my application is delayed. I guess the next step is to contact my MP, which I was really hoping to avoid. Will update here when I have more news...  \n**10Nov:** Still no news, so I've emailed my MP. Let's see what they say...  \n**13Nov:** MP has emailed back to say that she's chasing, but also warned me that her office typically get a reply within 4 weeks. Hopefully she or I hear back sooner than that... I'll let you folks know when I have news!  \n**17Nov:** Got a non-reply reply from citizenship.support@homeoffice.gov.uk saying that I need to email FurtherNationalityEnquiries@homeoffice.gov.uk - so I've emailed them, as well as the email that replied to me back in August (nationalityfurtherinformationrequests@homeoffice.gov.uk) with their very generic reply. Autoreply from FurtherNationalityEnquiries@homeoffice.gov.uk suggests that they aim to reply in about 20 working days and not to chase for a reply within that 20 working days. Also states very clearly that they will not reply to status request for applications that are under the 6 month threshold. They also note that they only handle applications made within the UK. Watch this space!  \n**18Nov**: Received a reply this morning to say that they've forwarded my email to the appropriate team: \"Thank you for your enquiry seeking progress of your citizenship application. Your enquiry has been sent to the appropriate team for their consideration and they will reply to you directly.\"",
